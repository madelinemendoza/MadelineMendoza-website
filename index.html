        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a freshman at Ucr in my second quarter. I am a pre-business major and plan on focusing on marketing. Within the next four years at UCR I plan to enter the business administration School Bachelor's in science program. I even hope to eventually get an MBA and get a job somewhere in marketing or maybe even start my own business. I don't have much experience in business or professional backgrounds considering I am a freshman in college however a couple of things that got me interested in marketing happened to be The fashion and television Industries. As an 18 year old girl I have an Insider's view on just how the media markets products towards younger Generations. I have been inspired by this because I see firsthand how my friends, sisters, and I are all affected by this directly. For example, newer companies are now taking to Tik Tok and Instagram to sell and market products. This is so because instead of Marketing products towards teens through television ads or billboards they instead know the whereabouts of the minds of teenagers these days. My hopes are to work for a big company on their marketing team. Possibly even through PR, PR is a new form of marketing used by companies to target viewers of social media influencers. The idea of PR is to Market your new products by sending them to influencers who have wide audience ranges and then have them try on, try out, and show your products. My computer science class at UCR has been helpful in working towards this ideal goal of mine considering we have already learned how to code websites and even send text messages from websites. Another professional route that interests me is also working for a marketing firm. A marketing firm Offers service to companies who are looking to Market their product. By using other companies, marketing firms often market products through which some techniques I have already explained, for example they will take over the social media page of a company and work their magic on it, in some instances they will also throw big events in cities like New York or LA to Market their product better through the media and celebrities. They will also put on photo shoots for the new product so that the company does not have to have services like these that are usually used by bigger companies such as Dior, Kin, and Laquan Smith. Other marketing professions that interest me are smaller skilled marketing tactics such as in grocery stores, malls, billboards and more however typically people who are more likely to Market on a smaller scale or marketing for their own company instead of seeking help from others. Finally marketing comes with a big responsibility of pricing and getting customers to pay for those prices. Since this is such a matter of mathematical process this has interested me over the years as I tend to do well in math classes. I hope to soon intern for a company that has great marketing tactics that I can as well learn from.

        I currently work as a cashier at a small family-owned business. The business is a specialty Market. We hold specialty items that no other stores in the nearby areas carry. Some examples of this are rare taco sauce and beers that cannot be purchased within a 100 mile radius. Just knowing these facts alone it is evident that my bosses have very great marketing skills. By holding specialty items that customers will drive for, they have made a business out of a regular mini grocery store. Our grocery store has very high prices and are considered to be convenience store prices however because we have specialty items customers tend to still buy regular items that are priced $2 over the regular price. The location of the market is also a very smart marketing tactic. Positioned in Redlands, California with mostly Elders surrounding it in the nearby vicinity, our Market is a prominent and key part of our city. Elders in the nearby houses are able to drive to only one store, as driving is too much for older people. Because these customers do not want to drive to other stores they end up buying everything they need at our specialty Market, meaning my boss makes a ridiculous amount of profit on almost every item they buy. To make matters even more convenient for my boss, the business is located down the street from a middle school. This Middle School is walking distance and has bad parking there for little kids in the Middle School come down to this Market Daly and buy sodas and candy. These little kids line up at the door and wait to be let in just a couple at a time just to buy sodas and candy. In return parents are able to pick their kids up in safe parking facilities. Not only location wise and item wise are my bosses smart but they also Have a very unique marketing tactics once you get inside of the store. One of the tactics I can recall is a $0.01 wine sale. This sale is where you buy one bottle of wine you can get your second bottle for $0.01 however you have to buy two of the same bottle. We profit off of this because the price of one bottle is actually the price of 2 bottles and while customers think they are buying only one bottle they end up paying for both without believing that they are. In return if the wine is good and they've gotten a so-called good deal on it they purchase it again. More tactics like this are used around the store for example buy one get one free deals on items like chickens and fresh meats. The market has also furthered its marketing strategies by adding in fun sections of the store over the years for example our beer section is actually a beer cave with fluorescent beer decorations and a cool cave you can walk into to buy our beer. We also have a small coffee bar where 2 employees work and serve coffee.

        A lot of the professional experience that I do have tends to be in philanthropy. Philanthropic work that I have worked on includes being a part of the Redlands Assistance League in the assisteens branch. I have also gone on trips to Mexico with Trinity Church to help build houses. Assistance League is a huge League where many people come together philanthropically to help organizations such as Boys and Girls Club and animal shelters.  We also used to throw huge parties for organizations in Redlands that would donate to our causes. We would reuse decorations from years prior and make elaborate parties in order to get the party attendees to make sizable donations to kids in need. We would also work these parties with Buster Boys & Buster girls and also servers. Another part of the Assistance League was its Thrift Shop. We would have worked at the thrift shop on the weekends considering we're all students. We would sift through the clothes in the back and donate clothes that did not look like it would be sold at our thrift store. We typically donated children's clothing considering there weren't lots of people with children who shopped at our store. Our crowd mostly consisted of older folks. During my time working at the thrift shop with Assistance League I also learned how to use the register.  I would use my customer service experience later on at the job that I have now as a cashier at a grocery store. One time for the assistance league, we got together in a group and made blankets for animals at the animal shelter. We then had a group of kids to go and take them to the shelter. Trips to Mexico with Trinity Church or for building houses for families in need. We drive mostly into Tijuana Mexico and sleep at a campsite the following day we wake up and build houses for families in need. The families that qualify or families that live in something close to that of the shack. It's a very sad and humbling experience and truly shows the difference between a second and first world country. Considering this is a normal way of life in Mexico conditions such as tin Shacks are very normalized there and the houses that we build them are luxuries in their eyes. I look forward to going on my third Mexico trip this spring break as it brings me lots of joy to help people in need especially when we are doing something as life-changing as building them a house. I hope to do more philanthropic work in the future and maybe even rejoin the Assistance League when I am older.I see philanthropic work as professional background as you are usually working with professionals who are orderly and know how to be assertive especially in places of need of order.
